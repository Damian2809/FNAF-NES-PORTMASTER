    <desc>In FNAF NES STYLED, you play as a night security guard at Freddy Fazbearâ€™s Pizza. Your main goal is to survive five nights while being stalked by animatronic characters that come to life at night. You monitor security cameras to track their movements and use limited resources like door controls and lights to protect yourself from being caught. The game is a mix of strategy and horror, requiring you to manage your resources carefully and stay alert to avoid the animatronics.
